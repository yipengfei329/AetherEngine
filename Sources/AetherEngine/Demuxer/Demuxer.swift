// UHD 蓝光的杜比视界是 Profile 7：基础层（HDR10）在 PID 0x1011，增强层与 RPU 在单独的 PID 0x1015。
// 引擎只看选中的基础层，于是按 HDR10 播放；增强层还被「只保留选中流」一并丢掉。这里在解复用层把两路配对：
// 基础层补上 P7 记录（bl_present_flag=1），增强层每个访问单元的 RPU 按 PTS 追加到同一时间戳的基础层包尾
// （Annex-B），下游现成的 P7 → 8.1 转换（只取 RPU、丢弃增强层）原样接手。增强层视频本身不送下游（FEL 的
// 增强信息在 Apple 平台上本来也用不上）。
//
// 配对依据：
// - 节目映射表里带 DOVI 描述符（0xB0）、bl_present_flag=0 的 HEVC 流就是增强层，记录照抄；
// - 实测 UHD 原盘（《疾速追杀4》）的节目映射表根本没有 DOVI 描述符，两路都只有 HDMV 注册描述符，杜比视界
//   只记在盘的 CLPI/MPLS 里。蓝光规格把 PID 0x1015 固定分给 HDR 增强层，所以 mpegts 里 PID 0x1011 与
